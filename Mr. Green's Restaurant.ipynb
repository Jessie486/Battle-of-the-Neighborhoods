He has been planning and now has the opportunity to open one in the city St. Louis, Missouri. This city is a popular tourist location, and Mr. Green is wondering where would be the best location to open his restaurant. He has two possible locations, one being near downtown and the other off the highway a few miles away. He has hired you, a Data Scientist, to look at these areas and advise him which location he should take.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Data Section"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "I will be using FourSquare Data of St Louis to analyze these two locations. \nFor each location, I will call FourSquare to check the top venues within 1-2 miles to determine which has more venues near it. I will visualize these venues on a map in relation to the 2 locations to see how close they are to each location. The closer these venues are to a location, then the more traffic to the restaurant.\nI can also check what kind of venues they are- the type of venues is important to know. If there are more restaurants in the area, that could mean more competition, but also more foot traffic to his restaurant. \n\nI can also use FourSquare to check trending venues near both locations at lunch or dinner time to assess how popular the nearby venues are. The more trending venues, then the more possible foot traffic to the restaurant.\n\nI will also search for other restaurants of the same category in town by a FourSquare search query. These are the competitor restaurants, and knowing where they are can help me choose the better location.
